/**
 * Pure helpers for mapping anime video IDs into plugin season/episode args.
 *
 * CloudStream / local plugins often catalog anime with **absolute** episode
 * numbers (season omitted). Meta video IDs for anime trackers are always:
 * - `kitsu:6448:68` → absolute episode 68
 * - `mal:63375:68` → absolute episode 68
 * - `anilist:12345:12` → absolute episode 12
 * - `anidb:…:N` → absolute episode N
 *
 * These trackers have no season component in the video ID (never
 * `mal:…:season:episode`). Season coordinates live only in TMDB/TVDB-style
 * IDs such as `tt2098220:2:10`.
 *
 * Passing UI S2E10 into absolute-episode providers matches absolute episode 10
 * (S1E10) instead of absolute 68. When the videoId already encodes the
 * absolute episode, plugins must use that with `season = null`.

/**
 * App-level (AAR mode) vendored Matroska extractor.
 *
 * <p>This package is a self-contained copy of AndroidX Media3's Matroska extractor and its
 * supporting EBML readers, relocated out of {@code androidx.media3.extractor.mkv} so it can be
 * compiled into the app alongside the stock prebuilt Media3 AARs. It exposes a {@link
 * com.foxtv.app.core.player.dvmkv.MatroskaExtractor.DolbyVisionSampleTransformer} seam that the
 * app wires to the libdovi bridge to perform DV7 to DV8.1 conversion for MKV, whose RPU rides
 * in BlockAdditional and is otherwise discarded by the stock extractor.
